# Nitric Oxide Analysis Application

This repo contains the code used to build the analysis application. Visit the app here: https://timfulton.shinyapps.io/Nitric_Oxide_Analysis_App/


### Background

I developed this app during my postdoctoral fellowship to measure blood plasma nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentrations through the analysis of nitric oxide (NO) using chemiluminescence.
