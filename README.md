### Background

I developed this app during my postdoctoral fellowship to measure blood plasma nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentrations through the analysis of nitric oxide (NO) using chemiluminescence. 


### Usage

Upload data using the browse button or use the demo data. The `Raw Data Smoothing Parameter` slider adjusts the amount of smoothing in the top figure. The `Peak Threshold` slider sets the threshold to exclude any peaks from the area under curve (AUC) analysis. The AUC is calculated for each peak and displayed in the table on the left side, where it can also be downloaded.
